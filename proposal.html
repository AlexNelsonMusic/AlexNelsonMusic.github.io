    <h1 id="final">Final Project Proposal</h1>

    <p class="proposal">For my final project, I want to create an environment in which you can create a visual representation of the audio set up for a live performance or a studio recording session. You will be able to create, position, resize and angle Image and text objects that indicate the type of audio gear used. This well especially be helpful as a visual representation of audio signal chains, which are often hard to fully conceptualize only in your head. It will also be good for visualizing more precise mic positioning in relation to the instruments being recorded. I usually Jerry rig PowerPoint to do this, but it always takes a really long time because I have to download a bunch of images and remove the backgrounds, but if I do all that work one time to create this then it would save me and anyone else who uses it a lot of time. There is obviously an endless list of different microphones and other audio gear, but I think it will be useful even if I just create objects for the most popularly used audio gear for now.</p>

    <p class="proposal">Javascript library to be used:</p>
    <a class="proposal" href="https://fabricjs.com">Fabric.js</a>
    <p class="proposal">This library looks like it will do what I want it to, but if there ends up being a problem that is a dealbreaker, I may switch to another Library. This shouldnâ€™t be an issue though, because it seems like there is a good number of libraries that do this.</p>

    <p class="proposal" id="example">Example diagram:</p>

    <p class="proposal"> I already had this made so I decided to use this diagram instead of Figma.</p>
